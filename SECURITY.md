- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress every week until resolution
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve confirmed vulnerabilities within 30 days for critical issues, 60 days for high severity, and 90 days for medium/low severity

### Security Update Process

1. **Verification**: We will verify and reproduce the reported vulnerability
2. **Fix Development**: Our development team will create and test a fix
3. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We will work with you to coordinate the disclosure
4. **Release**: We will release a security update and publish a security advisory
5. **Recognition**: With your permission, we will acknowledge your contribution

### Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a paid bug bounty program. However, we greatly appreciate security researchers who help us improve the security of our platform and will acknowledge valid reports in our security advisories.

### Security Best Practices

We recommend that all users:

- Keep the platform updated to the latest version
- Follow security best practices outlined in our [Development Guide](./docs/en/development.md)
- Use strong authentication mechanisms
- Implement proper access controls
- Regularly audit user permissions
- Monitor system logs for suspicious activity

### Security Features

The Enterprise Commerce Platform includes the following security features:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Keycloak Integration**: Enterprise-grade identity and access management

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Support for MFA through Keycloak

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption in Transit**: All API communications use HTTPS/TLS
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM protection
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and output encoding

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Docker containers with minimal attack surface
- **Network Segmentation**: Microservices architecture with isolated networks
- **Secrets Management**: Environment-based configuration for sensitive data
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of third-party dependencies

#### Monitoring & Logging
- **Security Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing and monitoring
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DDoS and brute force attacks
- **Intrusion Detection**: Monitoring for suspicious activities

### Security Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update our dependencies for security vulnerabilities using:

- **npm audit**: For Node.js dependencies
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Snyk**: Vulnerability scanning and monitoring
- **Manual Reviews**: Regular security assessments

### Security Configuration
